## 🎯Introduction & Problem Statement
Urdu, with its rich morphology, unique Nastaliq script, and agglutinative characteristics, presents significant challenges for automated text processing. While resources for English NLP are abundant, robust tools and well-documented practices for Urdu NLP are less common. This project addresses this gap by providing a foundational framework and practical examples for analyzing Urdu text data. Our goal is to empower researchers and developers to easily perform crucial text analysis tasks, extract meaningful insights, and prepare Urdu text for advanced machine learning and AI applications.
